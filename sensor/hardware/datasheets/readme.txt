These are the datasheets for the hardware to allow us to use the 
LoPy4 and PyTrack modules - or to develop our own replacement for the PyTrack board

Datasheets should include the LoPy4, PyTrack, PySense and the Honeywell PM2.5 measurement 
device, as well as useful ICs/Modules used on the PyTrack Board.

If we get time we can also include schematics and or layout of any proposed sensor solution. That would be the target.
